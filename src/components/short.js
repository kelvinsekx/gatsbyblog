        <p>I'm a front-end developer. But it just doesn't end there, I also have some little experience in back-end (using node), some love for UX,
          and currently learning python, but the front end is where I have more fun with. As a fun person too, my heart lies more with the front end. I love building projects that I find fun, useful, beautiful and accessible.

        I do magic with these prefered stack of node, react and graphql. Putting coding aside, I enjoy listening to good
        music and playing with oil and acrylic paints.
