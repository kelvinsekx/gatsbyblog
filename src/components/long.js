        He was initially more into artistical painting in his early undergrads
        days. And got into programming in his final years during the usual ASSU
        strike(But this strike was internal). He used the free time he had
        during the strike to learn html, css, and PHP. And the rest is more or
        less an history. In short, He is self taught engineer.

        {" "}
        He got into coding with PHP and later learnt javaScript. Now he is in
        love with javaScript and preaces JS everywhere he could.

        Currently because of his love for econometrics (that he so much hated in
        his grad days), he spends few time to master python and R language and
        how they could be used in data Science and econometrics. To
        him,econometrics is the future of economics and it is so fun.

        It is noteworthy to say that he is the very jovial type and no dull
        moment with him.

          Well, if you don't know, now you know at least. If you still don't

          home town
