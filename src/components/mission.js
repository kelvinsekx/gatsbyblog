        <p>Hi, Welcome and thanks for visiting.</p>
        <p>I'm a front-end developer. It just doesn't end there, I also have some little experience in back-end (using node), some love for UX.</p>
        <p> Currently I learn python, but the front end is where I have more fun with. As a fun person too, my heart lies more with the front end. I love building projects that I find fun, useful, beautiful, small and indeed accessible.</p>
        <p> I do magic with these prefered stack of node, react and graphql. Putting coding aside, I enjoy listening to good
        music and playing with oil and acrylic paints.</p>

          Oritsetimeyin with the tech alias of kelvinsekx. I am best described as an educator, developer and economist. I am a graduate
          of Economics and Education (B.sc[Ed]) from the prestigiuos{" "}
          <a href="https://www.ui.edu.ng">University of Ibadan</a>. And I am Nigerian and African. I really take pride in those.

          I was more into artistical painting in my early undergrad
          days. then later got into programming in my final years during the ASSU
          strike (but this strike was internal). I would use my free time during this strike to learn HTML, CSS, and PHP. The rest is more or
          less an history. In summary, I am a self taught engineer.

          After a while I got introduced into javascript and I really loved the animations that comes with it. So I fell in love
          love with the language and mastered it. I just wanted to be the best javascript developer from Africa, and I promised myself to master it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because of my love for econometrics, I spend few time to master python,
          How python could be used in data Science and econometrics. To
          me,econometrics is the future of economics and looking from the programmatic side of it, it will be fun.

          moment with me.

            Do you know that tall children are not taller than their parents?
            Well, if you don't know, now you know at least. If you still don't
            believe, then you would have been taller than the tallest tree in your
            home town
