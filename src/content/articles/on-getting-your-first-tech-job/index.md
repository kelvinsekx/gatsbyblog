Hhmm, haa (the depressing sigh with looking for that job)

As a beginner into tech or you're like me who is transitioning into it, after the whole hurdle of learning so much or so little to be tagged an "engineer" or "<whatever> developer", the big bang problem sets in quicker than you think, **getting that first tech job**.
In fact in the tech world here the first job thing is not very commonized so much that it is regarded as <em style="font-size: 150%">breaking into tech</em>.

How scary does that sound? 

In continuation, many advocate make it all worse when they tell us "...<span style="color: blue">it does not have to be that scary</span>" leaving out any ingredient to make it less scary for you and I, the newbies.

Unfortunately, I would have to come from the same angle but with a twist. <span style="">The truth is this </span>: <span>Getting the first job can just be hard like every relatively permanent awesome things in your life</span>. And that's my point, that you've faced similar difficulty all through your life, they are trivial now. 

Let me use myself as an example in this regard. There was a time I did not know 2+2. In fact, it took me more than a year to actually take a grasp on it. Well, today I will give the answer to that difficulty without even thinking.

Since you've accepted that part, you can decide to either appreciate the job search thing as "breaking into" or not. At least, you now can recollect plenty seemingly difficult things that you've achieved . Similar to the rest, job search can be a rigor, stress, with plenty unluck attached. A writer even described the process of getting one's first tech job as embarrasing and de-humaning.

Whether embarrasing, down grading or at worse dehumaning the search for the first job can be, breaking into tech is a big news we all want to be a part of, it is life changing. This blog is a letter to myself and the rest of us on the things I wished knew before I started the search and how to make the whole experience a little stressless for all of us.

## Dear Newbie,

### Dogayar: Accept Fate
Amidst the debate of fate and beliefs been of more good or bad, one thing can be rest assured: Belief and fate reduces stress and re-assures our future even if it ends been all messed up.

What I have been driving out from the opening paragragh is this, getting your first job can take sometime. It is natural.
I wished I had known this earliear believe me. If your friend, those white ones or who live abroad, got his/her first gig in few months after bootcamp do not fret or feel unlucky. It is all part of the process.


### Adofure: Learn the stacks you need to get that job 
When I started learning programming, I started with PHP, then moved to laravel. Worse in that I did not even have a drawn out plan of what I actually wanted in tech. I started tech because I loved it (what a fool I was) I lacked the knowledge of what backend or frontend development was even. It is that bad so much that I am self taught. After few weeks, I fell in love with JS as a result of the usual trial and error attached with self taught learners. It was Hell.

But don't make it hell for your self, before you move on from here, please, decide what you want actually from tech, be it frontend, backend, devOps, mobile dev... pick ONE, get the job requirements for it and learn them. It works magic trust me.

The bad news: As a javascript guy, there are more react, angular and nodeJS jobs resist gettinh stuck with the language.

If you choose to be a frontend engineer, learn the very basic of JS and move quickly into angular, vue or react. They will get you the job.

Although JS experts go against this approach, rather they belief in gaining a stronger knowledge of JS (languages) before moving to its libraries. But wait, will those experts feed you ? or pay your bills ? so fuck them. It doesnot matter get the result first.

### Javu: start to write that awesome CV
When I started programming, I never had a cv, worse I used resume templates online from money freakout sites when I was applying for my first sets of job.

You just started learning programming lastweek ? Write that CV. Writing the CV now is the best rather than later put pseduo projects at worse and work towards making them real. Nobody has the right to crucify you.

Also, when you start out writing your cv or resume (whatever they call them) better get the templates of of seasoned developers on the web they are every where online. Thats why I love the web ^(\__**_\_/)^.

Such resume would help you see into how recognised developers write there's and also look into projects they highlight in there resume real time. [Here is a link to mine]("https://ukuejubolakel.vin/assets/Kelvinresume.pdf"). I am not a seasoned developer though lol.

You can download the pdfs, convert them to word documents and make live edit ( What a life ). You can do the same for any seasoned developer resume online. Now thats cool.

### Wait: Don't send the resume yet
Sorry I told you to wait, but it matters dear.

Usually the height of confusion happens with plenty of applications without any feedbacks or rather worse "unfortunately we will not go on with your application..." emails. Cool down guy, don't rush to send that email with your cv.

Try to contact an in-house person in the company before applying, or say hii to an employee on twitter or just do some stupid link-up by searching the founders and values of the company. Ask questions if you get a response, know what they want, now twick your resume and apply.

Sincerely, this has really reduced my stress with the wayward applications here and there.

### No Job Yet? Do Something else
I know about a lady on twitter she is big developer in the US today. She made applications to over 250 jobs in the space of 4 months before she got her first gig. During this times, she would post her drawings on twitter and instagram as much as she was telling everyone of her job quest. Before she got her job, she has sold a substantial amount of her art.

While in search for that first gig try to be engaged in stuff outside job search. If you draw, draw more, if naa sing, sing more. If you love to write, write more like I am doing. I myself don't have a job.

### Yo're not alone
There is a platform for unemployed where you get subscriptions giveaway and other goodies. Oops, it does not exist.
Excuse my fantasy, I hope one day we have such forum though, the unemployed can meet up, get giveaways and connect. Where we just have fun and forget our sorrows.

Although it don't exist yet, you can chat me anytime, I have stupid things to always talk about. Trust me I won't snup. I am black, it is not my race that snups.

Not getting the job yet does not mean the world would end soon. Don't be depressed I love you.

### When you get your first job
I feel some things if we do them could help the good will for tech newbies. To be frank, having a newbie in a firm can be expensive and stressful on the side of the firm too.

Some of them are :
- Always appreciate your first employer. In fact, if you can, never remove that spot from your cv about the first employer. Learn to thank them and site them when you can. 
A developer once got a promotion on the first day at work. You know why? Because her boss saw her video where she was dancing about her first gig with the company name on it.

- Help newbies when you can. One at a time, a step at a time. I know of a female tech person who helps 4 newbie in a year on job search and recommendations. Two for each half of the year. She is a legend already. You too can be and even more.

- Please when it happens you got that job, share the news we love good news.

I hope it has worth your time. If it does, go henforth and be a better job seeker.
