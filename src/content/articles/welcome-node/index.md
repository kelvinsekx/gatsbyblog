May be you’re new to node.js or not, but it is undisputable that this post is most likely not your first introduction to node.js or the first time you’re hearing about node.js…NODE is now popularly and cannot be considered young any longer (first introduced in 2009,).

## The first question that is most likely to pop is ‘what is node’??

According to the official website, nodejs.org, “Node.js is a javascript runtime built on Chrome’s V8 javascript engine”. For me anytime I hear the javascript runtime thing, I get really confused. I seem not to know why…in fact I was above average with English Language in my school days, lol, but never seem to know why the javascript runtime thing confuses me. 

A simpler definition of the old content from the same official website defines:

Node as “a platform built on Chrome’s JavaScript runtime for easily building fast, scalable network applications. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking  I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices.”

The above definition might look lengthy, but it makes things so much clear to me with simpler use of words unlike the much summarized one.

## Lastly if you’re like me, you might want to make a little clarification on what V8 is or does.

V8 according to https://v8.dev is Google’s open source high-performance javascript and WebAssembly engine, written in C++. It is used in Chrome and in Node.js, among others. It implements ECMASCRIPT and WebAssembly, and runs on Windows 7 or later, macOS 10.12+, and Linus systems that use x64, IA-32, ARM, or MIPS processors.
