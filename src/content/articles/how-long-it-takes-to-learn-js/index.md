Yeeehuuuuuuuuu!!!!!!

Welcome as I tell you how long it will take you, my new friend, to learn javascript. Lol, I am kelvinsekx, a seer. Bow let me tell you something.

On a frank mood in this blog I will take you on the journey of **how long it should take you to learn Javascript**, the acronym being JS.
Join me on the adventure. 

## Adeumi : Emphasize on knowing and not time
A chinese adage says "time is not an ingredient for a perfect product"

Learn or the term learning can take a personalized definition. What learning is to me could not be to you. And learning is attached to a "degree". The degreee I choose to learn and degree I can learn is not the same with every other person.

Affirming to the truthfulness of that statement, learning and the degree to learn differs. My dear, if you choose to make one of the factor constant, the other one would suffer for it.

What I mean is this, if I put a cap to learn a phenomenom in 4 days (a constant), the degree of how much I would learn in 4 days would be affected. I could have rather mastered the subject more if given an additional 2 days. This leads to a question of: Is that really the quantity I wanted to learn ? Isn't it that I would have achieved the predetermined quantity in 7 days ?

I do not know what you define learning as, or how you choose to learn about JS. I would be biased to give a general answer with a constant time factor to every one here. But I can help still, to know yours read on.

## You cannot know all
If your answer to the previous discussion is that you wanted to learn all about JS from scratch, Lol, I laugh in japanese. This is impossible. Sorry I am passimistic but it cann't be talked better.

This leads to another question: say after me
> How much do I want to learn

## Kamakur : Sense of confidence
If you'd given an answer. What happens when you've achieved the degree you intend to learn is a "sense of confidence" and the more you surpass your learning target the stronger will be your kamakur (sense of confidence).

After I starte to master JS like I wanted, this strange sense of confidence came on me. I started to really enjoy JS more and became more confident even when I did not have a job yet.

## Shut up: It took me how long?
How long it took me to learn JS until I got to my kamakur was about 6 months. Yours can be lesser or longer.

## How to make yours lesser
- Do not compare yourself with others
Well you would think comparison increase speed to learn. But hell no it only frustrate. When you learn without comparison you actually learn faster.
- Get a job even when you've not reached your kamakur
You do not need to be very confident to start applying for a job not at all. This is because if you get lucky you would learn a lot on the job.
- Infrastructure dey change life
If you stay in those developing countries, getting tyhe right infrastructure can really reduce the time you would reach your kamakur. Learning to code can have some competitors which include healthy food, power or fuel for egenrators, a good laptop (notice good not best), and a learning community. Having thses inplace can really lessen the time you would reached the kamakur


Programming and learning JS can be hard trust me. But don't give up. Take thses pills when it tries to bring you down.
1. recollect what motivate you to started learning JS
3. You should have an goa: What you intend to mark as a sign that you've truly learnt. It can be a job or freelancing or contributting to open source.

Overall get a mentor.

By the end of this article you have discovered it took me six months to truly master JS most especially because I am self taught. But it can be lesser or worse. Whatever happens it is never a competition go and do great.
Bye

From kelvinsekx,
to you.
