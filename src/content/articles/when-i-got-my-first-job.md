In my mother's land after first degree all citizens are expected to on board on a 12 months compulsory service - NYSC. I was done with mine by June 31, 2020, usually what comes after service is "Job search". Mine was no exception.

Not until January of the subsequent year, I was working for free in a small farm somewhere in Ibadan. But Hey, I got a job offer as a teacher in a leading secondary school in the same area I lived. Before then, I have made a covenant with myself to only work per time as a teacher. Well do you need that part...let's move on.

And the day for the interview came. They were five who were to interview two of us. It wasn't a competition for both of us case been the school needed exactly the two numbers. Now to the big deal, I usually donot need any homo sapien to analyze my transcript because I know I can't fail an exams- it has never happened and that day would not be the first. So I was rest assured the indulgement was a breeze at least for myself.

When I entered I was told the number of subject to be taught. That can never be a
problem too, because it is about work - if the pay befits the hustle, do it else or elseif do not. I was asked what my pay range was. I declared the range in naira knowing fully well the minimum was the maxi pay for any teacher there.

After some talk here and there the minimum was reduced by some 30% thing as my salary expectations. At some seconds later, I was told "you got the job". Quickly did I expose there obscurity to the fact that I would only work for three working days and not the 5 working days of the immediate staff. If they had agreed to my former range I would have stucked to the plan still - 3 working days.

Well, after three days, I was told to resume on a phone call and the boss was happy to found a nerd working for the school. I was happy too...amhin it was a cool hustle since I was indulged in my software dev in free time.

REWIND: Before I took my leave on the interview day, we had a heat on the fact that I wanted to be payed whatever the incumbent full time teachers were payed. No conclusion was arrived at on the day. Somewhere in my brain, I was thinking I would negotiate the pay in camera with the school owner. 

After resumption, I raised the pay issue in camera, she was quick to snap me out of the unrealisticness of the demand from the school. 

After 2 months, I asked for an increment that which I deserved the other day. I was denied jettisoning the immense passion and deligence put into by me which have resulted in an undeniaable student performance in the school.

## What I learned

1. ask your worth every single time.
2. seal your best deal now and not in camera irrespective of what will be affected.
3. be the best in the world, it gave me the justification to demand an increment.
4. donot make medium plans on jobs that don't pay your worth or want your progress.


Now since I left, I witnessed some part you deserve to know if you had face the rigor to read this length. I earned far more than most teacher would on a full time considering the teaching pay atmosphere in Ibadan because I made my employer knew I would do well even if I left the job or wasnot employed. I am a developer and then was teaching one how to code when I got the par time teaching role. It was painless and powerful.

Get a skill friend, and make your employer know you are better if not given, and they will be betteroff if they gave you the job instead.

I am unemployed currently,  love coding and teaching people how to.
