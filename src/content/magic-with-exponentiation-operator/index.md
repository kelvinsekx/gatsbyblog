Yello! ECMA2016 standardized the exponentiation operator (**).

Before now, to make an exponent as simple as 2 raise to 2 would require the use of Math.pow() builtin function in javascript.
```javascript
{
  Math.pow(7, 3) // 343
  Math.pow(4, 0.5) // 2
}
```

For me, this is unnecessary long compare to that of python (**).

But goodnews, the exponentiation operator similar to python is standardized in JavaScript with support for all browsers except IE(Internet Explorer).

** The Exponentiation **

 The exponentiation returns the multiplication of the number on the left by the number of times of the number on the right. 

```javascript
{
 2 ** 3 //becomes 2 * 2 * 2 = 8
}
```

Same operation above becomes achievable with 

```javascript
{
  7 ** 3 // 343
  4 ** 0.5 // 2
}
```

Using the fastest means possible. Given an ordered list, return a boolean, true, if the output is achievable with the sum of a pair in the list. So that

```javascript
{
    [1,2,3,4] Given output = 8 //returns false
    [1,5,3,4] Given output = 9 //return true: since 5 and 4 are pairs that can be sumed up to the output 9
}
```
