Hello, I am very happy to see you here.This is my first post so it is good I make some impressions clear. I love being happy and meeting my lots of expectations. It makes me sad when I dont meet those expectations.
In that regard, here, I will be posting everything web development and fun things in between. If you like everything web too, YAY~~~ We are pals. You can help me share the fun and love I pass with every articles of mine if you deem it fit.

My articles are not aimed at complete beginners. I am very sad I couldnot make nicer writings or articles for newbies but do not worry there is just far more better newbie teachers and coders online. Sometimes I contribute to newbie writeup on  <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">Mozilla dev</a> I am a mozillian too. Please find it well to read the docs at <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">Mozilla dev</a> if you are a complete beginner or struggle with my writings, in fact that was how I got into javascript.

Leaving that aside, I write with you and me in mind, I love what I do and I write this articles with love. If you love me like I love you, say hi when you can on any of the platform just on the <a href="/">Home Page</a>

Also,this articles will be available once everyweek. I am working on a good plan for newsletter I am sorry I have to make you think to remember. This inconvenience would definitely not last.

On a closing note, I love criticisms, I love cooperation just like I love competitions, so if you get to see any issue on my writings please send a message and I will resolve it as fast as I can. 

Before I end this post, mummy I love you. You might not understand my writings or post, but I hope one day I make you just as happy as you have never been.
