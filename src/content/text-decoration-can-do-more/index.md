What if I told you, "developer, you really do not need a border".

As a newbie developer, one of the quick things I learnt concerning link style is to set the decoration to none.
```javascript
{
text-decoration: none
}
```

In fact most CSS books and course do not go into what more the text-decoration has to offer. For me I assumed the only value for text-decoration was even “none”. Until now, I got to know text-decoration can do a little bit more.

Text-decoration is the short hand for text-decoration-line, text-decoration-color, text-decoration-style, and text-decoration-thickness. And these variables are in no particular order. That is text-decoration-color can come first or last or in-between and vice-versa for any of the other variables.
```javascript
{
text-decoration: text-decoration-line |text-decoration-color |text-decoration-style |text-decoration-thickness
}
```

 Grandpa would always say "I will cut your legs, those ones you work with"

Me: ): Who works with the hands anyways.

Implement a Math.pow() like function. Give your function an interesting name, let it have two parameter(or arguments), so that

```javascript
{
    pow(2,3)//returns 8
}
```
